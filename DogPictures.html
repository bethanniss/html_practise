    <section id="Jackapoo">
        <h2><u>A Jackapoo</u></h2>
        <p>This is Ruby the Jackapoo. Jackapoos are not a recognised breed by The Kennel Club, but are a hybrid of a Toy Poodle and a Jack Russel . They have inherited intelligence from both lineages, and I think they will grow in popularity. </p>
